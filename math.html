    <p>I've participated in math competitions since middle school, where it all started when I made my school's MATHCOUNTS team in sixth grade. After some practice, I made the AIME in seventh grade and finally made the USAJMO in eighth grade. So far this year, in ninth grade, I'm still continuing my journey of mathematics!</p>
